Abbastanza Ã¨ sufficiente

----------

The bullets whisper gentle stain  
It's nothing, it's just a flesh wound...  
Drinking words, and lost in time  
For love speaks my soul renew, joined.  
Come with me, we'll simple let go.

----------

I can see, I can see  
the sunshine flutter away  
like a butterfly in the meadows.  
a life faids  
on the side of the street  
and my heart aches every time....  
I can see  
the land I dreamed  
shinning deep in your eyes.

# Breakfast at Auntie Elis

Winds of change  
Blessed saints  
Dogs and bitches  

All or none  
Some have said  
It was [all] for naught  

Save some grass  
And let the fellow  
Sleep to the sound  
of a crying mother

# Scared scarecrows and some watermelon

Sea breeze on winters porch  
Romantic promises over the hill  
Bug eyed people,  
  stepping over dog shit  

"come inside would you"  
"no" I said  
"why can't you stay"  
  asked the little lady  
"my friends are waiting"  
"they can stay too"  

"american knight,  
  how was the journey"  
no answer is given  
Romantic promises over the hill  
I sleep tomorrow if by chance  
you saved the watermelon....

# winter magic

has the Lion left or is He still around  
reveal the promise and speak the truth  

New Years Eve  
was like lying during the day  
full of face  
and under the sun  

not today honey the sun was late  
and I got skegs brains all over me  
just give up  
and go home

# The Corner of Her Eye

were do we go from here  
being in love with you  
is all I've been waiting for  

sometimes I've wondered  
about the different corners  
we grew up in  
just to come to the same place  

I'll see you  
  on the other side of dawn  
and I'll show you my world  
splendid in all it's simplicity  

when I see the corner of her eye  
I've seen the face of a lovers bloom  
it will be a while,  
  and I know I'll miss you  
but I don't forget about you and I  
and I'll tell you all the day  
about a lovers love  
so real, so free  

I'd really like to see you for a while  
you can hold me  
while we swim to the moon  

as you put your hand  
  on my knee in that way  
I hold the thought  
  just a little while longer  
timid and tame, longing for the day  
when I see the corner of her eye  

not the same as yesterday  
when we were kissing  
and the sun looked away in jealousy  
waking to the warmth  
  of her body  
I remembered when it was  
only one without the other

----------

# Something Disconnected

whispers on my skin  
numbs me with expanse  
of your infectious tenderness  
and I am no longer immune  
to the uninon of souls  

my blood runs freely  
you take it as your own  
your thoughts are often mine  
and our farthest dreams were a  
  mirror  
even before we saw the reflection.  

Robin Hood I ask of you  
to be the man of integrity  
that is just under your skin.  
Take our dreams along  
and at home  
I will take your hand.

# What Colour is my Heart

What texture is tenderness  
When you run your fingers  
  through my hair?  
What is the smell of thoughtfulness  
When we both surprise each  
  other with flowers?  
What is the intensity of our passion  
When we can't get close enough?  
What taste is your skin  
When I find I'm in a dream?  
What sound is joy  
When waves crash over us  
  and I'm in your arms?  

What colour will my heart be  
When I must be apart from you?  

----------

# Willing to Die

The time I said goodbye  
I remembered the time  
  I saw your face  
I remembered the time  
  I kissed your lips  

So many times I tried to say  
just how much I love you  
Could it be that we make it  
even when we don't know  
the path of our destination  

Celebration of loves love  
kisses of age old romance  
passions countenace, full  

Something known, sound of sight  
just a little longer  
the wind changes it's direction  
beside me, the woman  

It's you I saw  
  dancing in the dream  
Touching me now,  
  flesh to flesh  
warm, soft touch  
fear set in motion, trembling  

On September morning  
A clear voice of who we are.  
Do you remember the way it was  
when our spirits were lost.  

Lose to love, take the risk  
and you'll see her face  
ready to be the woman  

When he came home  
she was ready to take center stage  
the days that have gone  
often seem cold and lonely  
so I close my eyes  
and look into your face  
I find the peace,  
  that comes from us.  

Some people stay away  
living in fear of a touch  
I'm not above the rest  
but maybe the tears shed  
aren't spent for nothing.  

History heard our footsteps  
coming down the corridor  
and set aside a slice of time  
just for you and I.

----------

When I turn  
  to see...

I will see the face  
  of the Lion  
bright as the day  
more glorious than the sun  

Old friend  
  shine on me  

----------

# Teary Eyed

teary eyed princess  
streams of lonely silence  
the heart that stands alone  
troubled thoughts  
that never stop  

look into his eyes, child  
see his heart  
the child within  
he's living the last moments  
to try to hold on to her hand  
the touch that he longs for  

just say it's not time  
just say we'll see each other soon  
there has got to be more,  
so much more for you and I  

I wonder... why must I be so alone  
when I'm so in love with you

# Sarah, Sarah

The sun reached out  
and touched the sea.  
blazing shadows of remembrance  
that reared to shake the ground.  

Stillness of love  
strength of passion  
heaven's own song resounded  
as she whispered by.  
Song of truth, song of love  
perched at the gates of his heart  
whisper, whisper in my ear  
tell me clear and tell me true  
this is the one, or is there another  

Sarah, Sarah  
touched by an angel  
who is the one tenderly framing  
the passage of thy journey  
I came to awaken, turning to see  
the face of a Lion, shinning on thee.  
my heart skipped, my face did flush  
sword in hand, shielf of my passion  
for the one I've found to be true  
full of vigor, full of instinct  
the moment was right, the feeling was full.  
before I let the sword swing free  
a voice I heard from heaven's door.  
this is the one I have loved  
this is the one I have made  
the life I have given is precious to me  
never will it leave, never will it waver  
until the time I say it's to be  
the scar of the Lion is one to fear  
but life is the fruit of its wound  

Seated on a sliver of time  
I came to see  
the one I've found to be true  
scarred indeed  
but full of life and giving of life  
friend of the Lion  
just as I have known him to be.  
fear's reward at the end  
is the secret  
of safe passage and life indeed.  

Sarah, Sarah it is to be.

# I Believer That

it's time who mocks at the patience of a man in love.  
  his face is shaped without compassion,  
his promise wastes the body,  
eating away at the fabric of his jealous love.  
given up to time's lustful grasp, I gave her up  
  to an unfriendly affair.  
at night she sleeps with him, the sporting jester,  
  jeering at a lover's anguishing,  
frustrating efforts to keep his mind sane.  
given the distance, there is only one clear winner  
time walks away to a corner of the world with his prize.  
he sleeps with her knowing full well his is time.  
laughing at the fate of the lover drowning in insane excuses,  
chalking another victory to a distasteful trophy.  

given over, finally, to daughters of passion,  
his addiction to crave the love of his love,  
bleeding over, numbing the brain,  
only to get up and leave the room at the moment  
of revealing the truth of their twisted lives.  
this is the story of your life, soldier,  
the voice said unforgivingly.  
if we were to make a movie out of your life,  
let it be known yours would be lost.  
no use to try to pretend that you saw  
  some kind of wonderful,  
he continued, it's time to get up  
to go and visit your mother, father,  
they were willing to feast on your fleash  
and take away the pleasure  
  of losing to time.  

for the second time this one loses to his...   
  friend  
friendly time, time to walk on by, see  
  if those people really did find the fountain.  
conscious of his past, afraid of the  
  ghosts of Africa locked up for good  
  in his head,  
his fate is truly sealed, leaving nothing of  
  value, leaving nothing but scars.  
chuckling to himself, the host bellows out  
  to the spectators,  
we all told him he'd lose,  
now see him wasting away,  
cheeks of tears, dirt from groveling for the  
  first few scraps to come his way.  

alone, lights turned out, spectators gone  
to feed on their pigs eyes losing on another life,  
umpires dismissed, swollen with prideful bitterness,  
no one left to sweep the floor,  
only wind that fades as the grass  
  airs its only opinion  
pointing its finger straight and narrow,  
sitting alone, he thinks for awhile,  
realizing he can hear a beat, a beat that  
  speaks only to him.  
what beat do you dance to?  
if this is pure emotion, it's shattered my dreams.  
oh no that wasn't the one.  
to celebrate your glory, we'll let you free,  
you'll be right and understood  
full of glory,  
she's a priceless jewel, costs so much.  
the voice echoed again through his head  
i guess now it's  
  time

----------

bumps and bribes and leery men  
we want out and yet this is where it's at.  
a motswana tot slapped at me  
his sister asked for madi  
while safari trucks carry the ogling, pasty  
  holiday-bound  
and I trudge in the midst of it all.  
sand in my sandals  
squinting my eyes  
straddling the great  
divide.

----------

The clock stopped here while mine stayed ticking.  
Left is right and up is down.  
There's only dust when rain should fall.  
Things are costly though people are poor.  
When sweat dots his neck he drinks hot tea.  
Care for a swim on Christmas Day?  
The order of disorder,  
making sense from chaos  
just creeps and creeps and creeps and...  
have you succumbed to it or just  
  learned to understand  
how this clock ticks?

----------

Washing away  
dirtiness and despair?  
Where are the names of all who came before me  
and will my name join a list  
like a crowd of flies?  

Slipping away  
each day into the next.  
When will we accept that this is life  
and it is only what we make of it  
not what it makes of us?  

Throwing away  
the earth that supports us.  
How do we find the  
tangent  
between our physical existence  
and a continuation of the flame?

# Regretful Sarah

I once knew a girl  
who was schooled in New York  
She loved granola  
and spoke to [the] trees and birds  
and when you'd talk about the past  
or see about the future  
she'd say...  

no regrets Sarah, no regrets  
you only live your life once,  
(but then what's a life to live)  

Somehow I met her  
just when she'd be leaving  
we'd comfort each other with prosperous futures  
even though future is so uncertain  
(that neither of us knows)  
I can still hear as she'd say...  

no regrets Sarah, no regrets  
you only live life once,  
(but sometimes once is never enough)  

So Sarah, a tree's advice  
take what you have  
and make it a day  
come what may, I know (what)  

no regrets Sarah, no regrets  
life is just to short  
(so slow down to a stroll  
and I'll stoll along with you)  

whatever we've seen or said  
it's possible to use it  
to help with what's ahead  
and maybe we'll change  
we'd say  

seize the day, seize the day  
there's only one like it  
(but places are always the same to us  
and we've seen days that'll make  
a place look different to us)
