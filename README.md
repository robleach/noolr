Abbastanza Ã¨ sufficiente

----------

The bullets whisper gentle stain  
It's nothing, it's just a flesh wound...  
Drinking words, and lost in time  
For love speaks my soul renew, joined.  
Come with me, we'll simple let go.

----------

I can see, I can see  
the sunshine flutter away  
like a butterfly in the meadows.  
a life faids  
on the side of the street  
and my heart aches every time....  
I can see  
the land I dreamed  
shinning deep in your eyes.

# Breakfast at Auntie Elis

Winds of change  
Blessed saints  
Dogs and bitches  

All or none  
Some have said  
It was [all] for naught  

Save some grass  
And let the fellow  
Sleep to the sound  
of a crying mother

# Scared scarecrows and some watermelon

Sea breeze on winters porch  
Romantic promises over the hill  
Bug eyed people,  
  stepping over dog shit  

"come inside would you"  
"no" I said  
"why can't you stay"  
  asked the little lady  
"my friends are waiting"  
"they can stay too"  

"american knight,  
  how was the journey"  
no answer is given  
Romantic promises over the hill  
I sleep tomorrow if by chance  
you saved the watermelon....
